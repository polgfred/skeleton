# Skeleton

This is just the basic boilerplate to get a project started with the stuff I use a lot. Clone it and blow away the `.git` folder, run `yarn` and `yarn upgrade` and you're ready to go. But don't take my word for it. If you use some different stuff, fork it or copy it for your own purposes. No harm.
